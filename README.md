The objective of this project challenge is to expose students to the realities of real-world work in technology.

Constantly and quickly, students need to:

1. Study and use the source code written by others in your own applications. When working in groups, you will need to be able to read and understand other people’s source code. Also, in today’s world, your applications will need to integrate with other people’s systems (google maps? Social media?).
2. Learn new programming languages or technology that you need to accomplish a certain task. Usually, building new applications and systems will require learning new languages, frameworks, libraries, and the like.
3. To accomplish the two above in a limited time.
